# Assignment 4 Contextual Inquiry

## Problem and Solution Overview
Bruin Mobile is designed to simply be a mobile portal that blends UCLA content and resource links, supposedly to make obtaining UCLA resources easier. Students and faculty alike have trouble navigating the vast resources and information offered on campus. The app intends to address the physiological and safety needs for their users, such as providing a dashboard for the CCLE student portal app and the UCLA SafeRide app. This need is currently addressed by various UCLA websites and social media platforms, as well as word-of-mouth. There is currently no physical main information hub that will give a user access to all desired aspects of the community, and Bruin Mobile seeks to be that hub through digital technology. 

## Target Users
The app specifically targets the UCLA community, more specifically those who want to be updated on events on campus and who want to know and easily utilize resources and opportunities that UCLA offers. The majority of the pool of target users make up all current students, but can also include faculty and alumni. By representing the UCLA community, the user group hosts a large diversity of people, covering an age range averaging from 16-70 years old, varying wealth statuses, all major ethnic groups, those with disabilities, different careers, and so on. Users would be able to look for UCLA resources at any time and place they wish, as long as they have an internet connection.

## Research Method
I am conducting my interview(s) with my user(s) through participatory observation, in order to determine what the UCLA community wants when finding information about its campus. I will conduct the interview by myself as the interviewee, and will interview just one person at a time, in a non-distracting environment. The data will be collected via video, audio, and screen recording, as well as my own notes in real time. The interview will start with providing an introduction to the purpose of the study, and then a request for the user to explain how they would utilize their current tools to find out a specific event for the next day and a resource that they may need for their campus life. I will observe how they find the information and ask questions about anything that confused or interested me. I will conclude the interview by thanking them for their time and asking them if they see a need or a way to make this activity easier for their daily life.

## Reflection
The interview progressed smoothly and as expected with my friend and interviewee, Kailey Nichols, who is currently a sophomore studying Cognitive Science and is interested in the UX/UI field. The interview took about 30 minutes as predicted, and the questions that I was able to ask her shed some more light about the issues that some UCLA students and faculty face when living on campus. Kailey brought up some interesting points as a student, notably the difficulty of navigating campus and the lack of commuincation between departments. Despite the efforts to find a quiet space to conduct the interview, we still managed to get interrupted, which was a minor setback to the interview. From the two interviews we have conducted in this course so far, I am finding that having several devices available would be incredibly useful during the interview to collect data.
