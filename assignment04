## Problem and Solution Overview
Our product is designed to make the scheduling of activities more portable, convenient
and reliable. Many individuals, particularly those who are less comfortable with
technology, prefer paper-based scheduling tools, such as post-its and planners, rather than
electronic tools, such as Outlook or a Personal Digital Assistant. Pen and paper tools are
flexible, reliable and easy to use. Their weaknesses, however, are that they are easy to
lose, difficult to back up and are not accessible through a computer or the Internet. Our
product will offer the best of both worlds, by complementing a digital pen and planner
with a web site that can display and organize any event that the pen records.
