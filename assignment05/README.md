# Scenarios/Journey Maps
## Scenario 1 - Junior Jessica
  It's a Wednesday morning in the middle of the school year and Jessica, a UCLA student who is double majoring in Bioengineering and History, wants to check that she's on track to graduate. She opens up the UCLA Mobile app on her phone and logs in, letting her reference all the information she's bookmarked for herself and the automated suggested resources based on her user data. She brings up her Degree Audit Report from the "Academics" tab to see information showing first the degree requirements she is in progress to complete, followed by the requirements she has yet to complete, and finally the requirements she has already completed. Under the requirements that she has yet to complete, the courses that could fill those requirements immediately follow, and from that list, the available courses for the next quarter are highlighted, so that Jessica knows what she could apply to for the next quarter. She taps on a class that she is interested in, and is taken to a new page with the class description, which includes an explanation of the course, the professor leading the course, and the other requirements that the class fufills based off her degree customizations. 
  
## Scenario 2 - Freshman Fakhir
  Fakhir is only three weeks into his first year at UCLA, and due to his procrastination habits, he now is urgently searching for a printer to print out his report that's due in an hour. This is his first time trying to utilize any of the printers on campus, and he has no idea of what types of printing UCLA offers and where he could find one. He goes to his phone to open the UCLA Mobile device and clicks the "Map" tab. A new page with an interactive map of UCLA is displayed. Fakhir types "printer" into the search bar at the top of the page and can see from the now filtered results and description that the closest printer to him is in the next building over, charges 80 cents per page, and is confirmed to still be working by 3 students only 30 minutes ago. Fakhir rushes over to the printer and is able to turn in a physical copy of his essay in time. With the printer result displayed on the app, Fakhir confirms that the printer is currently still working by choosing a checkmark instead of an x mark, and puts the printer under his saved items on the map. 
## Scenario 3 - Professor Pam
  Professor Pam is looking to get more involved on campus, and wants to know what events are happening for the upcoming week. She uses the UCLA Mobile app and clicks the "Events" tab. The "Events" page is shown with a list of events with their date, time, and location. An image complements each event that provides a quick and helpful visual to Professor Pam. She notices two starred events at the top of the page that she clicked "Interested" for last week. One event is a Aerospace career panel, hosted by the Engineering School, and another is rocket project fair, an undergraduate student-run event. Professor Pam decides that she would rather go to the rocket project, because she is familiar with the club hosting the event and would like to get to know the students there more. By changing her status on the event from "Interested" to "Going", the club board members gets a notification that Professor Pam will be attending their fair and will prepare to greet her at the event.
