# DH 150 Assignment 6 - Low Fidelity Prototype
## Project Lux Low Fidelity Prototype

### Description
Project Lux is a redesign project aimed to improve the current features of the UCLA Mobile app. UCLA Mobile claims to blend "UCLA content and resource links while also featuring UCLA's dynamic app landscape collected into a sliding Apps dashboard for the ease of UCLA's broad and diverse community". By practicing usability testing, holding contextual inquiries, and developing user personas and scenarios, three tasks were determined to hold priority for the target audience, the student population at UCLA: knowing where things are on campus, such as buildings, offices, printers, and bathrooms; keeping track of courses and knowing what deadlines to keep in mind; and keeping up to date on the events on campus. 

### Process
#### Step 1
I first drew out the wireflow of the current UCLA Mobile app to determine what their priorities were and what I could learn from it. I found out that there was an interesting pattern in the amount of information provided the tabs—going through each tab from left to right provides less and less information as one goes along.

#### Step 2
From there, I used the data I collected from the usability tests and contextual inquiry to narrow down the redesign to 3 features: Map, Classes, Events. Below is my first rough conceptualization of a wireframe.

#### Step 3
I then made a flow out of the wireframe, where I cleaned up my drawings and added and took out some components.

#### Step 4
I then had my friend test the wireframe! She kept track of her progress with a yellow highlighter and marked her actions with a blue highlighter. She was able to work her way through all of the features of the wireframe, and gave me useful commentary along the way. She showed me that the capabilities of the reminder feature were ambiguous, and that it would be helpful to restate the name of the component for better understanding. She also pointed out another way of organizing the list of events and classes—I structured the items in terms of importance, but she brought up the idea of organizing in chronological order first and foremost.

#### My friend's progress on the Map feature:

#### My friend's progress on the Class and Events feature:

### Reflection
I believe that after the wireframe user test, I have to think about the organization of the lists of events and classes, to better suit the logic of a user. I also want to create a digital prototype to see if a user would think differently with a screen in front of them rather than a piece of paper. I created a digital wireflow as well, because it helped me reference layouts from other apps.
