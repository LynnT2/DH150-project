# DH 150 Assignment 6 - Low Fidelity Prototype
## Project Lux Low Fidelity Prototype

### Description
Project Lux is a redesign project aimed to improve the current features of the UCLA Mobile app. UCLA Mobile claims to blend "UCLA content and resource links while also featuring UCLA's dynamic app landscape collected into a sliding Apps dashboard for the ease of UCLA's broad and diverse community". By practicing usability testing, holding contextual inquiries, and developing user personas and scenarios, three tasks were determined to hold priority for the target audience, the student population at UCLA: knowing where things are on campus, such as buildings, offices, printers, and bathrooms; keeping track of courses and knowing what deadlines to keep in mind; and keeping up to date on the events on campus. 

### Process
I first drew out the wireflow of the current UCLA Mobile app to determine what their priorities were and what I could learn from it.

‚óè A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported.
A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.
A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you
got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
