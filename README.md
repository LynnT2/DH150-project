## What's Project Lux?
Project Lux is a redesign project aimed to improve the current features of the [UCLA Mobile app](https://apps.ucla.edu/mobile). The countless number of resources that our school offers are often difficult to find. In response, the UCLA Mobile app attempts to collect all of these resources, but fails to address the important needs of the student body in their everyday lives. With this app redesign, UCLA students at any stage of their college career would be able to have essential, but often overlooked, questions answered.

## Clear design statement: 
My first impression of UCLA Mobile was that despite its clean design, its purpose is unclear. The app's components lead to external website links, which could have been found by searching online. In short, the app isn't user-centered and adds steps to the user's journey. Students face many challenges and go under a large amount of pressure in collegeâ€”UCLA Mobile should make the college experience not more difficult, but easier to bear. By offering simple bits of information, such as the location to the nearest bathroom or printer and a reminder to finish a class assignment due the next week, Project Lux could improve the daily life of the thousands of students on campus. 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
At the beginning of this project, my goal was to improve the design and flow of the UCLA Mobile app. I started off with doing heuristic test to explore in greater depth the areas of the app that could be improved. I analyzed issues particularly in its "flexibility and efficiency of use" and its "consistency and standards". [Read more about my heuristics test here](https://github.com/LynnT2/DH150-project/tree/master/assignment01)

By performing a usability test, I wanted to understand the reason for the confusion and difficulty that I felt when performing my heuristic review of UCLA Mobile. I provided my tester with 3 tasks: Searching for vegan options in the dining halls, signing up for wheelchair basketball practices, and finding the Target Bruin Bus times. With the usability test, I was able to measure the ease of navigating through the app, the complexity of the app's structure, the consistency of parts in the app, and the level of knowledge needed to successfully utilize the app in its current state.
