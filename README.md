## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Lynn Tieu
I'm very proud to be a UCLA student and I love the environment that our school maintains to help us grow as people. UCLA has made several attempts to utilize current and trending technology to assist students with their campus life. However, the numerous phone apps created by the school hinder rather than help the user access the information and resources that UCLA wishes to provide. In order to better these resources, I will evaluate and analyze the **UCLA Mobile app** with the intent to provide students with an intuitive hub of information designed to fit the daily life of a Bruin, as well as **GroupMe**, a communication app widely used among students on campus.

# Heuristic Evaluation for the UCLA Mobile app
The UCLA Mobile app describes itself as a "mobile portal that blends UCLA content and resource links while also featuring UCLA's dynamic app landscape collected into a sliding Apps dashboard for the ease of UCLA's broad and diverse community".

My first impression of the app was that despite its simple design, the purpose of the app is not clear. The information provided is scattered and are given through what appear to be icons or other apps at first but end up being external website links that could have been searched online. The creators of the app should make more of an effort towards user research to understand the needs of their audience, UCLA students, and to create the ideal daily resource for them.

# 1: Visibility of system status
The icons within the app have a simple and effective response feedback. An icon will turn grey once clicked on to show what the user has clicked, and has a spinning icon as well, to indicate that a new page is loading. The spinning icon does not display the progress of loading a new page, leaving the user in the dark as to when to expect the page they clicked for.

Severity rating - 1
# 2: Match between system and the real world
The profile icon on the top right of the page is misleading to the user—the icon does not lead to a user's account settings as one would think, but rather lists types of notifications one could opt into, such as via email or text. 

Severity rating - 1
# 3: User control and freedom
Users are able to control where they want to go within the app. If they make the mistake of going on to an undesired page, they simply have to press the back icon on the upper left corner to return to the home page and start over again. 

Severity rating - 1
# 4: Consistency and standards
As stated in #2, the profile icon on the upper right corner does not follow the widely accepted function of providing information about a user's account. Instead, it is utilized as a notification settings page, The back button shown on the upper left corner on non-home pages is misleading as well. The back button, regardless of what order or placement the user is in the app, will take the user straight to the home page. This is a further confusing function since that operation is already provided by the home icon on the bottom home bar.

Severity rating - 2
# 5: Error prevention
The app is not complex enough to allow the user to make any actions that would create a user error—the app is essentially a pile of links rather than an interactive resource that may be prone to error.

Severity rating - 1
# 6: Recognition rather than recall
There is a search bar provided at the top of the home page. There is no indicator for what is meant to be searched and its purpose is lost to the user. Since the app does not provide a step-by-step guide of its functions, neither recognition nor recall is applied to this search bar. 

Severity rating - 3
# 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
The UCLA Mobile app fails to be an efficient tool for the students on campus. The icons and options listed on the apps all lead to different websites, prompting the question as to why download the app in the first place if the user is going to be led to a website that could have been easily reusable.

Severity rating - 3
# 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
The colors used are few and simple, mainly sticking to a white background and a baby blue text. I would critique the app to be too minimal—the addition of a third color would've added dimension to the overall design of the app pages and would have helped establish a better text hierarchy. The icons are supplemented with labels that take up space on the pages. Removing these labels would make the page feel less crowded with information, and finding icons that are more representative to the content on their page would improve a user's performance on this app.

# 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The app is not complex enough to allow the user to make any actions that would create a user error—the app is essentially a pile of links rather than an interactive resource that may be prone to error.

Severity rating - 1
# 10: Help and documentation
The app does not have a help or FAQ page that the user can reference, and leaves the user to fend for themselves when navigating its contents. There is no area within the app where a user could provide personal feedback on the app itself, displaying a lack of interest in the improvement of this resource.

Severity rating - 3

# Heuristic Evaluation for GroupMe
GroupMe describes itself as "A Home for All the Groups in Your Life". The dual website/app allows non-users to chat and interact as well, allowing supposed ease for a population of diverse people, like university students, to easilycommunicate with each other.

It is evident upon opening GroupMe that the app carries a strong focus on group conversations rather than individual messages like Facebook Messenger or iMessage. The app has a number of several features that cater to the group chat, such as polls and calendar events. The chat layout is clunky and outdated, and navigating the features of a group chat is confusing.

# 1: Visibility of system status
The icons have an effective feedback response— they will turn to a light grey once clicked on to show what the user has clicked. The chat messages are tracked with the date and time sent, so that the user will have no questions about the correspondence they keep.

Severity rating - 1
# 2: Match between system and the real world
The icons that GroupMe utilizes is intuitive and does not force the user to struggle to understand the meanings of icons.

Severity rating - 1
# 3: User control and freedom
Users are able to control where they want to go within the app. If they make the mistake of going on to an undesired page, they can swipe left or right to reach the page they were looking for.

Severity rating - 1
# 4: Consistency and standards
As stated in #2, the profile icon on the upper right corner does not follow the widely accepted function of providing information about a user's account. Instead, it is utilized as a notification settings page, The back button shown on the upper left corner on non-home pages is misleading as well. The back button, regardless of what order or placement the user is in the app, will take the user straight to the home page. This is a further confusing function since that operation is already provided by the home icon on the bottom home bar.

Severity rating - 2
# 5: Error prevention
The app does not have features that would require a user to receive preventative visual aid.

Severity rating - 1
# 6: Recognition rather than recall
The app fails to provide a search bar within the list of members in a group chat. This strikes as an inconvenience, especially to large student groups on campus who may need to quickly search for their members.

Severity rating - 2
# 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
The app is accessible to those without the app, making their software incredibly flexible to their audience. Sharing a group chat, however, is not searchable on the app and is dealt with by having shareable links and a qr code. Both methods cause the user's phone settings to pop up and trusts that the user will know where to go to copy the link and share the qr code. 

Severity rating - 2
# 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
GroupMe offers their traditional light design and recently released their optional dark design, giving their users more opportunities to customize their experience on their app. A critique can be given on the display of text between two or more people. In most other chat software, the user's messages are aligned left while their correspondence's are aligned right. GroupMe fails to follow this rule, choosing to align left for all messages. This, especially in a very active chat, makes for a difficult read.

# 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The app indicates message sending errors with red text and the option to retry or to cancel the message, making it very easy for the user to deal with errors.

Severity rating - 1
# 10: Help and documentation
The app has an accessible and well-categorized FAQ page that the user can reference, and gives the user the opportunity to provide their own feedback.
