## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Lynn Tieu
I'm very proud to be a UCLA student and I love the environment that our school maintains to help us grow as people. UCLA has made several attempts to utilize current and trending technology to assist students with their campus life. However, the numerous phone apps created by the school hinder rather than help the user access the information and resources that UCLA wishes to provide. In order to better these resources, I will evaluate and analyze the **UCLA Mobile app** with the intent to provide students with an intuitive hub of information designed to fit the daily life of a Bruin, as well as **GroupMe**, a communication app widely used among students on campus.

# Heuristic Evaluation for GroupMe
GroupMe describes itself as "A Home for All the Groups in Your Life". The app allows non-users to chat and interact as well, without a

My first impression of the app was that despite its simple design, the purpose of the app is not clear. The information provided is scattered and are given through what appear to be icons or other apps at first but end up being external website links that could have been searched online. The creators of the app should make more of an effort towards user research to understand the needs of their audience, UCLA students, and to create the ideal daily resource for them.

# 1: Visibility of system status
The icons within the app have a simple and effective response feedback. An icon will turn grey once clicked on to show what the user has clicked, and has a spinning icon as well, to indicate that a new page is loading. The spinning icon does not display the progress of loading a new page, leaving the user in the dark as to when to expect the page they clicked for.

Severity rating - 1
# 2: Match between system and the real world
The profile icon on the top right of the page is misleading to the user—the icon does not lead to a user's account settings as one would think, but rather lists types of notifications one could opt into, such as via email or text. 

Severity rating - 1
# 3: User control and freedom
Users are able to control where they want to go within the app. If they make the mistake of going on to an undesired page, they simply have to press the back icon on the upper left corner to return to the home page and start over again. 

Severity rating - 1
# 4: Consistency and standards
As stated in #2, the profile icon on the upper right corner does not follow the widely accepted function of providing information about a user's account. Instead, it is utilized as a notification settings page, The back button shown on the upper left corner on non-home pages is misleading as well. The back button, regardless of what order or placement the user is in the app, will take the user straight to the home page. This is a further confusing function since that operation is already provided by the home icon on the bottom home bar.

Severity rating - 2
# 5: Error prevention
The app is not complex enough to allow the user to make any actions that would create a user error—the app is essentially a pile of links rather than an interactive resource that may be prone to error.

Severity rating - 1
# 6: Recognition rather than recall
There is a search bar provided at the top of the home page. There is no indicator for what is meant to be searched and its purpose is lost to the user. Since the app does not provide a step-by-step guide of its functions, neither recognition nor recall is applied to this search bar. 

Severity rating - 3
# 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
The UCLA Mobile app fails to be an efficient tool for the students on campus. The icons and options listed on the apps all lead to different websites, prompting the question as to why download the app in the first place if the user is going to be led to a website that could have been easily reusable.

Severity rating - 3
# 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
The colors used are few and simple, mainly sticking to a white background and a baby blue text. I would critique the app to be too minimal—the addition of a third color would've added dimension to the overall design of the app pages and would have helped establish a better text hierarchy. The icons are supplemented with labels that take up space on the pages. Removing these labels would make the page feel less crowded with information, and finding icons that are more representative to the content on their page would improve a user's performance on this app.

# 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The app is not complex enough to allow the user to make any actions that would create a user error—the app is essentially a pile of links rather than an interactive resource that may be prone to error.

Severity rating - 1
# 10: Help and documentation
The app does not have a help or FAQ page that the user can reference, and leaves the user to fend for themselves when navigating its contents.

# 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
The UCLA Mobile app fails to be an efficient tool for the students on campus. The icons and options listed on the apps all lead to different websites, prompting the question as to why download the app in the first place if the user is going to be led to a website that could have been easily reusable.

# 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
The colors used are few and simple, mainly sticking to a white background and a baby blue text. I would critique the app to be too minimal—the addition of a third color would've added dimension to the overall design of the app pages and would have helped establish a better text hierarchy. The icons are supplemented with labels that take up space on the pages. Removing these labels would make the page feel less crowded with information, and finding icons that are more representative to the content on their page would improve a user's performance on this app.

# 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The app is not complex enough to allow the user to make any actions that would create a user error—the app is essentially a pile of links rather than an interactive resource that may be prone to error.

# 10: Help and documentation
The app does not have a help or FAQ page that the user can reference, and leaves the user to fend for themselves when navigating its contents.
