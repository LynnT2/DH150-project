## What's Project Lux?
Project Lux is a redesign project aimed to improve the current features of the [UCLA Mobile app](https://apps.ucla.edu/mobile). The countless number of resources that our school offers are often difficult to find. In response, the UCLA Mobile app attempts to collect all of these resources, but fails to address the important needs of the student body in their everyday lives. With this app redesign, UCLA students at any stage of their college career would be able to have essential, but often overlooked, questions answered.

## Clear design statement: 
My first impression of the app was that despite its simple design, the purpose is unclear. The app's components lead to external website links, which could have been found by searching online. In short, the app isn't user-centered and adds steps to the user's journey. Students face many challenges and go under a large amount of pressure in collegeâ€”UCLA Mobile should make the college experience not more difficult, but easier to bear. By offering simple things such as the location to the nearest bathroom or printer and a reminder to finish a class assignment due the next week, Project Lux can potentially improve the daily life of the thousands of students on campus.
