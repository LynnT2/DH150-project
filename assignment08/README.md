### Description
Project Lux is a redesign project aimed to improve the current features of the UCLA Mobile app. UCLA Mobile claims to blend "UCLA content and resource links while also featuring UCLA's dynamic app landscape collected into a sliding Apps dashboard for the ease of UCLA's broad and diverse community". By practicing usability testing, holding contextual inquiries, and developing user personas and scenarios, three tasks were determined to hold priority for the target audience, the student population at UCLA: knowing where things are on campus, such as buildings, offices, printers, and bathrooms; keeping track of courses and knowing what deadlines to keep in mind; and keeping up to date on the events on campus.
